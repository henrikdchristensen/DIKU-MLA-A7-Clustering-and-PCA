    "Sleep is one of the most fundamental physiological processes, and abnormal sleeping patterns are associated with poor health. They may, for example, indicate brain- & heart diseases, obesity and diabetes. During sleep our brain goes through a series of changes between different _sleep stages_, which are characterized by specific brain and body activity patterns. _Sleep staging_ refers to the process of mapping these transitions over a night of sleep. This is of fundamental importance in sleep medicine, because the sleep patterns combined with other variables provide the basis for diagnosing many sleep related disorders (Kales and Rechtschaffen, 1968, Iber and AASM, 2007). The stages can be determined by measuring the neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex (via electroencephalography, EEG), eye movements (via electrooculography, EOG), and/or the activity of facial muscles (via electromyography, EMG) in a _polysomnography_ (PSG) study. The classification into stages is done manually. This is a difficult and time-consuming process, in which expert clinicians inspect and segment the typically 8â€“24 hours long multi-channel signals. Contiguous, fixed-length intervals of 30 seconds are considered, and each of these _segments_ is classified individually. Algorithmic sleep staging aims at automating this process. The state-of-the-art in algorithmic sleep staging is marked by deep neural networks, which can be highly accurate and robust, even compared to human performance, see the recent work by Perslev et al. (2019) and references therein.\n",

    "This assignment considers algorithmic sleep staging. The data is based on a single EEG channel from the Sleep-EDF-15 data set (Kemp et al., 2000, Goldberger et al., 2000). The input is given by an intermediate representation from the U-Time neural network architecture (Perslev et al., 2019), the targets are sleep stages. We created a training and test set, the inputs and the corresponding labels can be found in `X train.csv` and `y_train.csv` and `X_test.csv` and `y_test.csv`, respectively.
